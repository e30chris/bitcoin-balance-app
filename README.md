# Go Web App

This is a Go web application project that demonstrates a basic web server setup and handling HTTP requests.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `cmd/main.go`: This file is the entry point of the application. It contains the main function that sets up the web server and starts listening for incoming requests.

- `pkg/handlers/handlers.go`: This file exports a package-level function `HandleRequest` that handles the HTTP request and response. It can contain additional handler functions for different routes or endpoints.

- `go.mod`: This file is the Go module file that defines the module name and its dependencies. It is used for managing dependencies and versioning.

## Getting Started

To run the Go web app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd go-web-app`
3. Build the application: `go build ./cmd`
4. Run the application: `./cmd`

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:<port>`, where `<port>` is the port number specified in the `main.go` file.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- `github.com/gorilla/mux`: A powerful URL router and dispatcher for Go.
